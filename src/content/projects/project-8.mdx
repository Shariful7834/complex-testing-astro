$f(x)$. So we have, based on our assumptions, a system that can be
described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in one dimension. Typically,
in modeling projects ODEs are written down from the very start and

it appears that modelers sometimes forget about the assumptions that
have been made in order for these types models to be valid.<NumberedMarginNote reset={true}>

**Always remember what assumptions ODE models are based on.**

For the above particle annihilation example we can now try to derive
the appropriate $f(x)$. Remember that $x(t)$ is the number or abundance
particles.
<NumberedMarginNote>This is the margin note content, which will appear in the margin and be linked to the superscript number.</NumberedMarginNote> 

Now let's assume the perspective of a single $A$ molecule labeled
$i$. In the time interval $t,t+\Delta t$ this single molecule can
encounter another particle $j$ and both can annihilate. The probability that
our marked molecule encounters any other particle should be proportional
to the abundance of the molecules altogether. So the expected change in the
abundance caused by a _single molecule_ $i$ is

here's an equation $f(x)=x^2$, and here's a display equation:

$$
\int dx f(x)=\frac{1}{\pi}
